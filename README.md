# Voice-Based-email-for-visual-impairment-people-using-AI
This is my final year project which is "A voice-controlled email sender system that allows users to compose and send emails,check inbox,trash,sent emails by searching also using speech commands.

**Abstract:**

E-mail is a widely used method of communication, serving both professional and social purposes. However, 
for blind users, traditional email applications present significant challenges, particularly since they must rely on memory 
to navigate through the keyboard or keypad. The proposed system aims to address this issue by offering a voice-driven 
email platform, enabling blind users to send, receive, and view emails without needing to memorize a keyboard layout. 
This voice-based system provides access to various email folders, such as the inbox, sent items, and trash, all through 
spoken commands. The integration of a speech recognition model helps in recognizing both the language and voice of 
the user. By transcribing spoken words into written text accurately, the system allows users to interact with their email 
accounts hands-free. The process of converting speech to text is known as "speech-to-text" or "automatic speech 
recognition" (ASR). Additionally, Google Text-to-Speech (GTTS) technology is employed to convert the input text into 
audible speech. Two important protocols, SMTP and IMAP, are used in email communication: SMTP handles the sending 
of emails, while IMAP is responsible for retrieving and managing messages. The outcome of this work is the development 
of the “Blind-Friendly Email System” prototype.
