# Voice-Based-email-for-visual-impairment-people-using-AI
This is my final year project â€” a voice-controlled email system that enables users to compose, send, and manage emails using speech commands. It supports accessing the inbox, sent items, trash, and searching emails by voice.

**Abstract**

This project is a voice-driven email system for visually impaired users, enabling them to send, receive, and manage emails using spoken commands. It uses speech recognition to convert speech to text and Google Text-to-Speech (GTTS) for audio responses. The system uses SMTP to send emails and IMAP to retrieve them, providing a hands-free, accessible, and user-friendly communication platform.

**Technologies**

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python

Framework: Flask

Database: PostgreSQL
